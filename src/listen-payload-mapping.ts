/**
 * Listen-route payload mapping — the `with { field: <expr> }` clause.
 *
 * A `listens` entry's `payloadMapping` is `{ targetField: SExpr }` (see
 * `TraitEventListener.payloadMapping`). Applying it rewrites the SOURCE trait's
 * outgoing payload into the shape the LOCAL trigger expects before the internal
 * event dispatches. ONE contract, shared by every delivery path: the server
 * runtime (`OrbitalServerRuntime`) and the client cross-trait wiring
 * (`@almadar/ui` useTraitStateMachine).
 *
 * Every value is a full s-expression evaluated against the source payload —
 * `?field` renames, but also `(object/get ?request "accepted")`, `(str/concat …)`,
 * object and array literals. This mirrors `orbital-core`'s listener fan-out
 * (`runtime/listener.rs:126-136`, `runtime/kernel.rs:696-707`), which evaluates
 * each mapping value through the canonical `Evaluator` with a payload-only
 * binding context.
 *
 * The evaluator is injected rather than imported: `@almadar/core` sits upstream
 * of `@almadar/evaluator`, so the caller — which already holds one — supplies it.
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
