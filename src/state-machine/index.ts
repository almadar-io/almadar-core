/**
 * State Machine Graph Algorithms
 *
 * Pure functions for state machine analysis: graph construction, BFS
 * reachability, guard payload derivation, and replay path building.
 *
 * These algorithms are shared by:
 * - orbital-verify-unified (compiled project verification)
 * - runtime-verify (interpreted runtime verification)
 * - Almadar Studio (visual state machine editor)
 * - AI agent (schema analysis and generation)
