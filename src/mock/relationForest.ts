/**
 * Deterministic self-relation forest — the ONE seeding policy for a
 * self-referential relation field (`Tag.parentId : Tag`, `ChatMessage.replies
 * : [ChatMessage]`), shared by every mock seeder.
 *
 * Before this module each seeder invented its own policy: the interpreted
 * path (`MockPersistenceAdapter`) built a deterministic binary forest for
 * `one`/`many-to-one` self-relations but handed `many` self-relations 2-4
 * RANDOM other-row ids, and the compiled path's seeder (`MockDataService`)
 * assigned every relation field — self or cross-entity, any cardinality — one
 * random id with no forest at all. Random cross-linking on a `many`
 * self-relation means every row ends up referenced by several others, so
 * under a default `onDelete: restrict` policy nothing is ever deletable — the
 * `std-realtime-chat` `ChatMessage.replies` case this module fixes.
 *
 * The forest guarantees exactly one root (row 0, never referenced by any
 * other row) and no cycles: row *i*'s parent is always row ⌊(i−1)/2⌋, a
 * strictly smaller index.
 *
