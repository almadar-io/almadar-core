/**
 * Semantic kind marker for a pattern prop. Complements the structural
 * `types` field (which declares "string" / "array" / "object" / ...)
 * with meaning — *what is this value, beyond its JSON shape?*
 *
 * Consumers of the patterns registry (the Rust compiler's inline phase
 * in `orbital-compiler`, the JS preprocess in `@almadar/runtime`, and
 * verifiers in `@almadar-io/verify`) read `kind` to decide whether a
 * prop participates in call-site `events: { OLD: NEW }` renames,
 * entity substitutions, and similar structural rewrites. Without this
 * marker, consumers fall back to name-matching heuristics that drift
 * between implementations — the problem this field eliminates.
 *
 * Kinds:
 * - `"event"`      — the prop value is a declared event key (string).
 *                     Inline phase rewrites via the trait's events map.
 *                     Source type: `EventKey` from `@almadar/core`.
 * - `"event-list"` — the prop is an array of action-descriptor objects.
 *                     Each item has a field (default `"event"`, override
 *                     with {@link PatternPropDef.eventField}) holding a
 *                     declared event key. Same rename applies per item.
 * - `"entity"`     — the prop is the pattern's data INLET: the bound entity
 *                     record(s) it renders. The inlet half of the circuit,
 *                     symmetric with the event OUTLET kinds above. Source type:
 *                     `EntityRecord<T>` / `EntityCollection<T>` from
 *                     `@almadar/core`; {@link PatternPropDef.cardinality} says
 *                     which. Consumers bind the domain entity to it without
 *                     name-matching the prop (replacing the `'entity' in
 *                     propsSchema` name check).
 *
 * Reserved for future use: `"config-binding"`. Add here rather than
 * inventing per-consumer markers.
